# Cheat sheet

If you want a fast, high-signal overview of Silk surface syntax, start with the
canonical cheat sheet:

- `docs/language/cheat-sheet.md`

This wiki page exists to keep wiki navigation self-contained; the cheat sheet
itself is already concise and example-heavy.

## Example (Works today)

```silk
fn main () -> int {
 return 0;
}
```
