# Syntax tour

The canonical syntax tour is a soup-to-nuts walkthrough of Silk surface syntax,
with many examples and cross-links:

- `docs/language/syntax-tour.md`

This wiki page keeps navigation self-contained and highlights where to look
next when you want precise rules.

## Example (Works today): minimal executable

```silk
fn main () -> int {
  return 0;
}
```
